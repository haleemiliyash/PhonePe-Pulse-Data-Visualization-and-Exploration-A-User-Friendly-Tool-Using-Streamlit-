PhonePe started in 2016 and has been a strong beneficiary of the API driven digitisation of payments in India.

**REQUIREMENT:**
**Stearmlit**: Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Create beautiful web apps in minutes.

**Python**:Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
